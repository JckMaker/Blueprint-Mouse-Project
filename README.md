This is my take on the "Squeak Mouse" starter project... 
ive always been in need of a second mouse and whats better than designing and making my own, for FREE!
my design is supposed to be bit of inspo from the glorious model O, the hexaganol cut outs and of course i added my initials/name to it
hope you like!

Disclaimer! there could be issues with the files going from ipt to whatever else.
